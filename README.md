- Hi, I’m Colin Arnet
- I'm currently finishing my master studies at ETH Zürich. For my master thesis I search for missing compiler optimizations with the help of binary analysis.
- My interests are in general software engineering. I am especially interested in automated testing methods, compilers, high-performance computing and systems programming.
