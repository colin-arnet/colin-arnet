- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Colin Arnet
- ğŸ‘€ I'm currently finishing my master studies at ETH ZÃ¼rich. For my master thesis I search for missing compiler optimizations with the help of binary analysis.
- ğŸŒ± My interests are in general software engineering. I am especially interested in automated testing methods, compilers, high-performance computing and systems programming.
